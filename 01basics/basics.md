# Basics

## Data types

| Type           | Example               |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| Integers       | -2, 1, 0, 45, ...     |
| Floating point | -1.25, 0.9, 43.7, ... |
| Strings        | 'Hello', 'World', ... |

## Variables
Variables can be named in almost any form, just be sure that variable name follows next rules:

- Can be only one word.
- Use only letters, numbers, and underscore (_).
- Canâ€™t begin with a number.
- If variable name starts with an underscore (_), is considered as "unuseful".

```python
# Valid variable names
fullName = "John Doe"
full_name = "Jane Doe"

tax1 = 15.3
tax2 = 0.16

# Invalid variable names
full name = "John Doe"

1tax = 15.3
_available-4-trash? = True
```

## Math operators
Ordered by precedence, descending.

| Operator | Operation       | Example       |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| **       | Exponent        | 2 ** 3 = 8    |
| %        | Modulus         | 22 % 8 = 6    |
| //       | Integer divison | 22 // 8 = 2   |
| /        | Division        | 22 / 8 = 2.75 |
| *        | Multiplication  | 3 * 3 = 9     |
| -        | Substraction    | 5 - 2 = 3     |
| +        | Addition        | 2 + 2 = 4     |

## Comparison Operators

| Operator | Meaning                  |
| -------- | -----------------------  |
| ==       | Equal to                 |
| !=       | Not equal to             |
| <        | Less than                |
| >        | Greather than            |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to |
